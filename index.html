    <h1>Adam Hendrickson</h1>
    <p>Adam Hendrickson is 22 years old and lives in the Northwest Suburbs of<br>
       Chicago, Illinois. He has a variety of hobbies, including music composiiton,<br>
       animation, software design, and he is even fixing up an old harpsichord!<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>On May 2, 2000, Adam Hendrickson was born. From a young age, he was fascinated<br>
      with music. Specifically, theme songs to his favorite childrens shows, and the music<br>
      he would hear in the background score. While also developing a hobby for building Legos,<br>
      Adam would seek out any musical soundtrack material he found interesting.
      The harder it was to find, the more he wanted it.<br>
      This all came to a climax when Adam was 12 and discovered the score to an<br>
      old Cartoon Network show called Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. Adam had never heard such wonderful<br>
      music, and desperately wanted to add it to his growing music collection. Alas, The Foster's Soundtrack does<br>
      not exist anywhere. So Adam thought, "if I can't have it, I'll just have to make my own". This launched Adam into<br>
      a new phase of his life, learning HOW to write music.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Computers?</h3>
    <p>
      As Adam got older, he continued to pursue his composition hobby, creating hours and hours of original music,<br>
      alongside covers of the Foster's Soundtrack of course. He also began to become interested in other things,<br>
      like computers. Computers were and still kind of are a total mystery to Adam. How do they even work? At around<br>
      the age of 13, Adam decided he would figure this out, and began to learn the Java programming language. Through the years,<br>
      Adam would begin many coding projects, usually strange game ideas, or tools to help with his homework. One time he even<br>
      tried to animate by programming everything out (it did not look good, but he did not give up.) The most public of Adam's<br>
      programming projects is a text-adventure game titled You are The Speaker. Programmed by Adam in 2019 and conceptualized by<br>
      two friends of his, You are The Speaker is an overhauled ZORK experience, featuring a map mechanic, interesting play features,<br>
      puzzles and more. Unfortunately, it is unlikely You Are The Speaker will ever see continued development, as it's original story<br>
      writers have little interest in the project anymore. While Adam wishes he had more polished projects to demonstrate his skills,<br>
      he is well aqcuainted with the mindset of a programmer, and finds the logic of computers relaxing and enjoyable to learn about and execute.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>What about The Future?</h3>
    <p>
      After production on You are The Speaker halted, Adam began creating what he calls the "ultimate output for all my creative energy",<br>
      which is an animated series about him in high school, learning about music. The show itself follows a young Hendrickson through a<br>
      fictional high school, and a key point in the show is Adam's obsession with The Victorians Soundtrack (a nod to Foster's Home).<br>
      With the music being the focal point of the show, and over 90 minutes of screentime under his belt, Adam feels completely confident<br>
      in his show-making method, and wishes to continue this until the project's inevitable finale. Alongside this, Adam is currently enrolled<br>
      in the Front End Software Development Bootcamp, offered through Promineo Tech. This website, in fact, is an assignment for that very class!<br>
      Adam wishes to polish his software development skills, allowing him to build a comfortable life for himself, where he is free to do all<br>
      of his favorite things and more.<br>
